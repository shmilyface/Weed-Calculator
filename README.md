In an attempt to create a more individualized and interactive user experience, we sourced a credible, documented equation to create a calculator that can take a strain from the dataset we scrapped from Leafly, that prints out the THC potency based on experience levels and the type of high desired.

**Formula:** 

 $${P}={10(G * S)}$$

**P = Potency (amount of THC ingested)**

**G = Grams (of strain in flower form)**

**S = Strength (THC %)**

*Note*: In comments after formula in Ohm's Law link, author states "The formulas work perfectly for both flower and concentrate, because the weight and potency are both factors. You can use the formulas (or just a simple calculation), for instance, to show that a typical gram of concentrate is approximately equivalent to a typical eighth ounce of flower."

This information is given by numerous dispensary information websites. I called a local dispensary (Local Cannas House, Spokane WA) and they confirmed it as a unofficial industry standard for recommending and discussing dosage with customers, as well as being part of the sourcing for the calculator we were inspired by, seen here, in the LA Times article:
